# use the macOS github desktop app to clone: https://github.com/jeromegit/fomonomo-tv
# but the cli way to do it assuming that it's clone into the directory fomonomo-tv:
git clone git@github.com:jeromegit/fomonomo-tv.git fomonomo-tv

# to install dependencies
yarn install

# to see if it still works locally
yarn run

# run to create static-website app that we will merge with our react web app clone earlier
sls create --template-url https://github.com/serverless-guru/templates/tree/master/serverless/static-website
# merge the 2 package.json and
# copy the scripts
cp -r static-website/scripts .
# cp the serverless.yml file
cp static-website/serverless.yml .
# rerun this so that it installs the serverless-finch plug-in mentioned in the serverless.yml file
yarn install

# Build the app
yarn build

# deploy the app on aws either for dev or prod
yarn run deploy dev us-west-2
yarn run deploy prod us-west-2

# I had to jump thru hoops to connect AWS Route 53 that holds the domain fomonomo.tv to connect with my CloudFront
# I had to create a CA certification using DNS which takes a while to issue
# it kept of failing because the certificate needed to be created on the US East (N. Virginia) region... grrrrr!
# See here for details: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/easier-certificate-validation-using-dns-with-aws-certificate-manager/
# Reminder that I use S3 as static website hosting and
# I use CloudFront (like a CDN) on front of it to allow to do smarter redirect of error and makes the new files available to the world faster
