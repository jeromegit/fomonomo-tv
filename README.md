This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Impetus

I wanted to play around with the latest React (on a mobile platform) + the AWS Serverless framework and I needed something concrete to work on.

This web app (optimized for mobile platforms) makes it very easy and fast to look up TV shows, actors, seasons, etc... thanks to [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## Status

Still very much a work in progress but this is working: http://fomonomo.tv/
